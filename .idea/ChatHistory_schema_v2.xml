Here are some steps you can try:\n\n1. Make sure your project-level (root) Gradle settings include the repositories you need. For example, in your top-level settings.gradle (or top-level build.gradle if you have an older project setup), you should have something like:\n   ┌─\n   dependencyResolutionManagement {\n       repositories {\n           google()\n           mavenCentral()\n           maven { url \&quot;https://jitpack.io\&quot; }\n       }\n       ...\n   }\n   └─\n   This ensures artifacts hosted on JitPack (like \&quot;com.github.lopspower\&quot; and possibly some other libraries) can be resolved.\n\n2. Check that you have installed Android SDK 35 (or whichever version you have specified for compileSdk/targetSdk) in the SDK Manager. If it is not installed or is unavailable, install it or switch to the latest stable version (for example, 34).\n\n3. Verify your internet connection and Gradle proxy settings, if any. Failing to resolve dependencies could be as simple as a network timeout.\n\n4. If you are using a dependency version that doesn’t exist or has been taken down, Gradle will not be able to resolve it. Double-check that each dependency version you declared actually exists in Maven Central, Google’s Maven repo, or JitPack.\n\nBy ensuring your repositories are set up high-level in the project (particularly JitPack if you need it), verifying each version you’re using is valid, and installing the correct SDK, you should be able to fix the “Could not resolve all files for configuration” error.&quot;}]}]}" />
